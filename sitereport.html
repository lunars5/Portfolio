         <h2>My Overall Module Experience</h2>
         <p>I really enjoyed this module! Learning HTML and CSS was straightforward but still fun, because of this I found myself hooked, improving the layout and styling at every opportunity. The module itself was taught well provided a great introduction to web development and programming in general.  I am happy with how my website turned out.</p>
         <h2>Development and Learning Log</h2>
         <p>I first created a basic and consistent layout with html, header, aside, sub headers (h2), paragraphs, footer and nav. This was for index.html, cv.html, portfolio.html, contact.html and sitereport.html. Though I would have preferred to keep the nav tag, I later removed it and replaced it with a div tag, as I was struggling to get the hamburger menu to work without. I changed the styling and layout using 3 different css stylesheets, one default style sheet main.css, one desktop for larger computer screens, desktop.css and mobile.css for smaller screens up to 1000px. The main difference between the desktop and mobile site was the grid layout used, in the mobile version the aside bar, where I placed images with links to my contact information, moved to under the header. This was to make it more user friendly for mobile users as it is easier to use on smaller screens. I also added a hamburger menu for the mobile site. I found this section to be very challenging. I tried to use the method taught in lectures, using anchors and target selector, however it did not fully work. I completed the css burger menu and the change in menu so it was in the top half of the screen, I could press slide the menu down, but could not get it back up again. After a lot of trial and error I looked online for any other options (12), hoping to adapt it with what I had already. I ended up using a different method with a animated menu icon. To do this I did have to use position absolute which I thought would be acceptable, as the brief states that position absolute should not be used for something that is always displayed on the screen and this is not as it is only visible on the mobile site and when the icon is clicked. </p>
         <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
         <p>I chose a grey, white and pink colour scheme. This was because it looked simple and professional, but mostly as the plain but contrasting colours would make it easy to view and read for anyone visiting the webpage.  I used a consistent background image, and images for icons along the right side that were links to external webpages and my contact page. In the aside I also added an animation to an image, making up move up and down, the animation stops in the mobile version. As previously mentioned, I changed the grid layout for mobile devices, however I also changed to various layouts for the index.html, cv.html, portfolio.html and site report.html, I thought this showed that I understood the grid layout, as well as for styling purposes, and that different layouts suited the different purposes of the pages. </p>
         
         <h2>Ups</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Seeing how much the css changed the styling of my webpage</li>
            <li>Trying different layouts, stylings, colours and box model</li>
            <li>Contact page was very enjoyable to implement and see in action</li>   
         </ul> 
         <h2>Downs</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The amount of time getting the hamburger menu to work</li>
            <li>Getting used to github and remembering to make regular commits</li>
         </ul> 

         <h2>References and Inspiration</h2>

        <p> For the layout and design, I did not have any spesific websites I used for the design inspiration, I just new I wanted it to look clean, sophisticated and not overly complex. All images used throughout are referenced below with file names. I have also referenced my inspiration for the hamburger menu mentioned above. </p>  </p>
